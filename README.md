# Portfolio-performance-visualization
## Objective
To visualize the performance of investment portfolios, compare returns across assets, and track risk. This insight helps investors optimize their portfolios, assess performance, and make data-driven investment decisions.

## Implementation
1. Data Source
 - Stock prices, portfolio allocations, historical returns (can be sourced from financial APIs, CSV files, or databases).
2. Libraries Used
 - Plotly: For creating interactive financial plots, particularly useful for time-series data and portfolio performance visualization.
 - Matplotlib: Ideal for creating static plots such as historical trends and risk-return comparisons.
3. Types of Visualizations
 - Line Charts: Track portfolio value over time, helping visualize growth or decline.
 - Scatter Plots: Visualize risk vs. return for different assets, providing insights into the trade-off between risk and reward.
 - Heatmaps: Analyze correlations between asset returns, identifying diversification opportunities.

## Expected Outcome
By following the implementation steps, investors can:
 - Track portfolio performance over time and visualize growth or decline.
 - Compare returns from different assets to make informed investment decisions.
 - Analyze correlations between asset returns to optimize portfolio diversification.
